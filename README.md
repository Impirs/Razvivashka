## Installation help

### English

Installer (recommended)
1. Open Releases and download the latest installer: `play_and_learn-Setup.exe` (no other files needed)
2. Run the installer and choose an install path
3. Windows may show a security warning; choose ‚ÄúAllow/Run‚Äù. The app is safe ‚Äî the notice appears because the certificate isn‚Äôt from a commercial publisher
4. Finish the setup and start the app

ZIP archive
1. Download the latest `.zip` from Releases
2. Extract it into its own folder (don‚Äôt mix with unrelated files)
3. Run `–†–∞–∑–≤–∏–≤–∞—à–∫–∞.exe`

Security warning (Windows)
- You are installing software, which modifies files on your machine (normal for installers)
- The signing certificate may not be trusted by Windows yet because this is not a commercial publisher; you can allow the app to run

## Refactor (React + TypeScript) preview

We‚Äôre rebuilding the app with React + TypeScript, Vite, and a stronger architecture (Electron main + preload bridge; typed contexts for settings, language, user/records, game controller, notifications). Styling will gradually move to Tailwind CSS.

- Source: `react-refactor/` (renderer in `src_ts/`, Electron in `electron_ts/`)
- Architecture and refactoring notes: see `react-refactor/refactoring.md`

If you only want the stable app ‚Äî use the Vanilla edition from Releases above. If you‚Äôre curious about the new architecture, start with the documentation linked above.

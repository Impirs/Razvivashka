# 🧠 Welcome to Razvivashka!

**Razvivashka** is a collection of educational games designed to train and improve cognitive skills.

## 💡 Why this helps your child

Our games are built to help children develop abilities useful at school and in everyday life:

1. 📚  Make learning easier — trained memory and attention help kids remember letters, numbers, words, and rules faster.
2. 🎲  Make play more meaningful — logic games teach problem solving and seeing relationships, which builds independence.
3. ⚡️  Faster reactions — exercises for reaction speed help children respond quickly to new situations.

> **Most importantly:**
> 
> 👉 Even if you don't give your child a phone or tablet, you can use the app's ideas as tabletop, verbal, or active games. All exercises are easy to adapt for family play — in the car, at home, or on a walk.

This way the app becomes more than a "screen game" — it becomes a real **assistant for parents**, suggesting exercises you can do with your child for balanced development.
